1;German bank LBBW wins EU bailout approval;Landesbank Baden Wuertemberg;"Germany's Landesbank Baden Wuertemberg won EU approval Tuesday for a state bailout after it promised to shrink its balance sheet by 40 percent and refocus on lending to companies.
 The bank was several state-owned German institutions to run into trouble last year after it ran up more huge losses from investing in high-risk proprietary trading and capital market activities -- a business the EU has now told it to shun.
 Seven current and former managers of the bank are also being investigated by German authorities for risking or damaging the bank's capital by carrying out or failing to block investments in high-risk deals worth hundreds of millions from 2006.
 The European Commission said its Tuesday approval for the state rescue of the bank and its new restructuring plan would allow it become a viable business again -- and that the cutbacks would help limit the unfair advantage over rivals that the bank would get from the state aid.
 Stuttgart-based LBBW earlier this year received a capital injection of (EURO)5 billion from the bank's shareholders  all of them public authorities or state-owned  including the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg  the region's savings bank association and the city of Stuttgart.";Negative
2;8th LD Writethru: 9th passenger released from tourist bus hijacked in Manila;Rolando Mendoza;"The Philippine National Police (PNP) identified the hostage taker as former Police Senior Inspector Rolando Mendoza. Mendoza was dismissed from service for extortion and forcing a chef to swallow  ""shabu.""
 Two police officers  Superintendent Orlando Yebra Jr. and Chief Inspector Romeo Salvador  have started negotiations with Mendoza.
 Mendoza is demanding authorities to clear his name and be reinstated to the service.
 MPD spokesman Police Chief Inspector Erwin Margarejo said in a press briefing that the use of force against the hostage taker will be a last resort. He added that Mendoza's demand for reinstatement will be studied and will undergo undue process.
 Philippine President Benigno Aquino III has appealed to Mendoza to ""honor and respect"" the lives of hostages. The government is hoping that tourists will view it as an ""isolated incident"" and that ""it does not reflect real situation of the country.""
 Mendoza was carrying an M-16 rifle when he abducted the bus  with plate number TUU 799  Monday morning. The abduction was held near Rizal Park  a major tourist site in Manila.";Neutral
3;Commission: Bar Liberian president from office;Charles Taylor;"Sirleaf  70  acknowledged before the commission in February that she gave up to $10 000 to a rebel group headed by Charles Taylor. Sirleaf said the money she sent while an expatriate was meant for humanitarian services and that she was never a member of the group  the National Patriotic Front.
 Information Minister Laurence Bropleh said Monday evening if the public had had any dissatisfaction with Sirleaf's involvement with Taylor at the time  they would have voted against her in 2005.
 In 2005 the Liberian people knew that President Sirleaf had contributed $10 000 to Taylor's movement  Bropleh said.
 An AP correspondent and others who covered the Liberian war can recall no humanitarian works by Taylor and his fighters  especially in the first months of the war when tens of thousands of refugees were fleeing across the borders to Ivory Coast and Guinea  where they were helped by international and government agencies.
 Then  most atrocities were committed by Doe's forces and Taylor was welcomed as a liberator fighting a barbaric dictatorship.
 ""In defense of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  she never hid the fact that she was curious about Taylor and what he was all about "" said Huband  who drove with Johnson Sirleaf on her first trip to meet Taylor in May 1990. ""A lot of people supported the idea of Doe being ousted and there had been so many attempts  and they all were foiled  at least one with the help of the American government  which continued to support Doe despite his brutality.""
 ""I never had the impression that Sirleaf supported Taylor  certainly not after it became clear his troops were out of control "" Huband said. ""Certainly there was no way she could predict the kind of atrocities that would be committed (by Taylor's fighters) ...""";Negative
4;AP Exclusive: Network flaw causes scary Web error;Sawyers;"Sawyer logged off and asked her sister  Mari  31  her partner in a dessert catering company  and their mother  Fran  57  to see whether they had the same problem on their phones.
 Generally Web sites and computers are compromised from within. A hacker can get a Web page or computers to run programming code that they shouldn't. But in this case  it was a security gap between the phone and the Web site that exposed strangers' Facebook pages to the Sawyers. Misconfigured equipment  poorly written network software or other technical errors could have caused AT

T could confirm only that the problem occurred on one of the Sawyers' phones  possibly because they had logged off Facebook on the other two before reporting the incident.
 It's unclear how many people were affected by the problem the Sawyers discovered  and whether it was limited to Facebook.
 Usually that means a Web site simply won't load  said Alberto Solino  director of security consulting services for Core Security Technologies. In the Sawyers' case  ""somehow they got the wrong user but they could keep using that account for a long period of time. That's what's strange "" he said.

 Hussein said Friday she would rather go to jail than pay any fine  out of protest of the nation's strict laws on women's dress.
 The case has made headlines in Sudan and around the world and Hussein used it to rally world opinion against the country's morality laws based on a strict interpretation of Islam.

 As a U.N. staffer  Hussein should have immunity from prosecution but she has opted to resign so that she could stand trial and draw attention to the case.
 In a column published in the British daily the Guardian Friday  Hussein said her case is not an isolated one  but is a showcase of repressive laws in a country with a long history of civil conflicts.

11;Ted Cruz , asked if he 's interacting with Texans , says he 's done 17 ` town halls ' in 2017 .;Ted Cruz;"But could it be that U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas does n't get personally grilled by constituents very often ? 
The listed events Cruz attended from April through August 2017 demonstrate that the term ` town hall ' can be stretched every which way , even to events not open to the public . 
All told , it looks to us like Cruz took questions at gatherings of selected constituents , mostly business employees -- with the three veterans events open to members of the public who registered . 
Regardless , the Houston lawyer was told during the 2017 Texas Tribune Festival about a Democratic challenger 's suggestion that Cruz had n't visited small Texas towns during the term he won in 2012 . 
""Do you do enough interaction with your constituents , Sen. Cruz ?"" 
Cruz , asked if he interacts enough with constituents , said : ""In 2017 , I 've done 17 town halls"" in Texas . 
Cruz replied : ""That is a huge part of the job . 
A town hall , Cruz spokesman Phil Novack later noted by email , is defined by Merriam-Webster as ""an event at which a public official or political candidate addresses an audience by answering questions posed by individual members ."" 
Cruz , a Republican poised to seek re-election in 2018 , hardly has a reputation of avoiding attention . 
Novack otherwise told us Cruz had held 19 town halls with Texas constituents in 2017 , all ""organized by third parties who determined attendees , where"" the senator ""has taken unvetted questions from anyone in the crowd -- at businesses , factories , chambers of commerce , and in public venues ."" 
The businesses , including Division Laundry & Cleaners in San Antonio , Sysco Central Texas in New Braunfels and Igloo Products Corp. in Katy , had employee town halls with Cruz , the chart says . 
The veterans group , per the chart , hosted Cruz at July events in McKinney , Austin and Houston . 
By email to our inquiry , a CVA spokesman , Jim Fellinger , told us each CVA event with Cruz was open to the public by registration , without the group screening out anybody who registered . 
Fellinger pointed us to video posts of the CVA events showing that Cruz each time took questions via a moderator , who recognized a few individuals to speak directly to Cruz . 
Cruz 's office lists 19 events . 
Next , we confirmed from press releases , news stories and video snippets that Cruz made the appearances described in the Novack-provided chart . 
Events in bold on the chart below were open to reporters , Phil Novack , a spokesman for Sen. Ted Cruz , said . 
SOURCE : Chart provided by email from Phil Novack , press secretary to U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz , Sept. 28 , 2017 . 
We also asked Novack to share 2017 events Cruz had in Texas that were open to the public without registration -- where anyone could ask a question on any topic . 
Experts evaluate Cruz 's claim . 
Next , we shared our annotated version of the chart by email with academic experts and requested appraisals of Cruz 's statement that he 'd done 17 ""town halls ."" 
It seems these town halls are open only to the people from the sections of ` town ' that support Ted Cruz . 
In contrast , Trim , who directs a Pepperdine public engagement institute , said Cruz 's use of the ""town hall"" term struck her as ""valid within the common use of the term ` town hall ' in 21st century America ."" 
Mark Jones , a Rice University political scientist , said Cruz 's claim fits a ""minimalist"" definition of town hall in that they involved the senator speaking to , and fielding questions from , constituents from all walks of life across the state . 
But for a town hall ""maximalist ,"" Jones wrote , none of Cruz 's events would qualify as a town hall ""because they were held in largely controlled settings and were not open to the general public"" with the exception of the veterans gatherings open to people registering ahead of time . 
John Gastil , a Penn State University professor , said that while the ""town hall"" term has lost clarity of definition over the years , he thinks Cruz 's claim was made to affirm his availability to the public . 
Cruz 's claim ""strikes me as dubious ,"" Gastil summed up .";Negative

 Zarewa also said police found the unexploded bombs after an alleged Boko Haram bomb attack on a police station in Gamboru  a building destroyed by rioting sect members in July 2009. The rioting  as well as a subsequent security crackdown  left more than 700 people dead.
 Followers of Boko Haram  which means ""Western education is sacrilege"" in the local Hausa language  went into hiding after the July 2009 riot  as police began arresting anyone caught listening to or holding a sermon by the sect. However  officials now fear the group has rearmed. A video recording released in late June showed a Boko Haram leader calling for new violence as the one-year anniversary of their attack neared.
 Boko Haram has said it wants a stricter version of Islam's Shariah law in place across Nigeria. Nigeria  a nation of 150 million people  is divided between the Christian-dominated south and the Muslim north. A dozen states across Nigeria's north already have Shariah law in place  though the area remains under the control of secular state governments.

18;New Questions About Progressives' Power;Blanche Lincoln;"But as Sen. Blanche Lincoln proved by winning the bruising Democratic primary runoff  Democrats do not necessarily serve at the pleasure of the party's left flank. Lincoln survived a massive and unprecedented mobilization by labor unions and liberal advocacy groups in Arkansas  raising questions anew about the political power of the progressive movement.
 Labor alone spent some $10 million on the race  airing an onslaught of advertisements assailing Lincoln for her connections with corporate interests  and had hundreds of paid workers in the state canvassing on behalf of her runoff opponent  Lt. Gov. Bill Halter. High-level union organizers poured into the state in the closing days of the campaign  feeding facts and figures to reporters to tout the likelihood of Lincoln's defeat _ a victory they were convinced was theirs.
 Lincoln's win stunned labor and progressive leaders. But regardless  they said every penny spent to support Halter was worth it. Forcing Lincoln into a race for survival  they said  demonstrated to other moderate Democrats in the country that support from the party's liberal base cannot be taken for granted.
 Steve Rosenthal  a veteran labor organizer who was a key strategist in the campaign against Lincoln  said forcing her into a runoff and having Halter come within four percentage points of her on Tuesday was ""a phenomenal victory.""
 ""There are other senators sitting on Capitol Hill saying  `I don't want to go through what Senator Lincoln went through ' and that's the important lesson "" Rosenthal said. ""The labor movement is about protecting rights and expanding rights for workers. As long as the labor movement is seen as spending its resources only to protect Democrats  it loses.""
 It was an audacious move for labor to take on a sitting senator in a conservative right-to-work state that gave rise to Wal-Mart and where labor unions have long been weak. But the labor movement was bullish  believing Lincoln to be vulnerable. In Halter  an ambitious politician who had long eyed higher office  the movement believed it had found the right vessel with which to sink Lincoln.";Neutral

25;Berlusconi in new scandal over Italy judge dinner;Silvio Berlusconi;"Premier Silvio Berlusconi is steeped in a new scandal over a dinner he had at the home of a constitutional court judge who will rule on a key decision whether to grant him immunity from prosecution while in office.
 Opposition lawmakers have called for the removal of the judge  Luigi Mazzella  and a colleague who participated in the mid-May dinner  saying there would never be any way to know whether Berlusconi influenced their deliberations on the immunity issue.
 The court began debating the constitutionality of a law last month that grants Berlusconi  the Italian president and two parliament speakers immunity from prosecution. Berlusconi's forces had pushed the legislation through parliament last summer  saying it was necessary for the government to function.
 At the time the bill was passed  Berlusconi was on trial on corruption charges in Milan  fueling criticism that the bill was tailor-made to save him from prosecution. The premier's trial was suspended pending a decision from the constitutional court  which is expected soon.
 Cabinet minister Elio Vito defended the premier  saying Berlusconi hadn't organized any meeting about the legislation but was rather invited to a dinner by a friend well before the court began deliberating the case.
 Berlusconi has long been dogged by conflict of interest allegations as well as corruption charges stemming from his years as a billionaire media mogul. He has either been acquitted -- sometimes thanks to laws passed by his own government -- or seen cases against him expire under the statute of limitations. He has always maintained his innocence  claiming he is the victim of a conspiracy of left-leaning magistrates.";Negative

";Hillary Clinton;"Despite the big bucks and big support that Hillary Clinton has received from Harvey Weinstein for decades , do n't expect the 2016 Presidential candidate to say anything significant soon about the extensive sexual harassment allegations swirling around the much-accused Oscar-winning producer . 
The Leonardo DiCaprio , Jennifer Lopez , Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick attended event was one of many Weinstein was involved in last year in Clinton 's battle for the nomination and then against Donald Trump in her effort to become America 's first female President . 
Pushing others to write hefty checks , Weinstein himself gave thousands personally to Clinton campaign and $ 30,000 to the Clinton Victory Fund . 
""She 's damned if she does and damned if she does n't now in this situation ,"" a deep-pocketed Tinseltown donor to the Democrats told Deadline of any statement by Clinton about the scandal that has seemingly buried now ex-The Weinstein Company boss . 
An October 6 editorial by the NYT advocated that Clinton and Obama , who once in office was also was the recipient of support , big donations and a summer internship for one of his daughters from Weinstein , should speak out about the allegations . 
With the candidate there in person , a June 20 , 2016 fundraiser at Weinstein 's Manhattan home snared $ 1.8 million for the Clinton campaign . 
The latter , like Hillary Clinton , has said nothing . 
""You 'd hope for better , but this is so typical Clinton denial , is n't it ?"" 
Having given a keynote address at Stanford University and continuing her ""What Happened"" book tour in San Francisco the day after the New York Times published a detailed piece on Weinstein 's behavior and six-figure settlements , Clinton made no mention of the reports or the producer . 
Clinton does still calls herself a ""women + kids advocate"" on her Twitter bio and says ""To all the little girls watching ... never doubt that you are valuable and powerful & deserving of every chance & opportunity in the world"" on a pinned tweet dated November 9 , 2016 . 
https:t.coUXlIV1JuOF -- Hillary Clinton -LRB- @HillaryClinton -RRB- October 9 , 2017 . 
Clinton is scheduled to appear in Davis , CA tonight for ""What Happened"" event . 
Having backed Hillary Clinton 's NY Senate run and her 2008 race against Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination , Weinstein was a major donor and bundler for the ex-SecofState 's Hollywood cash vacuuming 2016 campaign .";Negative

31;Canadian police critized for death;Paul Kennedy;"The officers told a public inquiry in British Columbia that they fired because they felt threatened by Dziekanski  who was holding a stapler  but Kennedy said he doesn't find any of the officers' statements credible.
 ""The fact that the members met together prior to providing statements causes me to further question their versions of events "" Kennedy wrote.
 Kennedy repeated his earlier recommendations that the force tighten its Taser policies and create an independent body to investigate officers in serious cases  such as those involving a death.
 Kennedy's recommendations aren't binding on the RCMP or the federal government.
 The commission's reports often include a response from the RCMP  but in this case Kennedy's findings were released without including the force's input.
 Kennedy's investigation  as well as several others including the public inquiry  were launched after the amateur video of the confrontation was made public.";Neutral
32;Wrong Way in Thailand: Can a State of Emergency Lead to `National Reconciliation'?;Abhisit;"After bloody clashes between the Thai army and opposition demonstrators killed some 90 people in the center of Bangkok in May  the unelected government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva promised to launch what he called a ""national reconciliation plan."" Since then authorities have arrested hundreds of opposition leaders; closed media; frozen the bank accounts of suspected supporters of the Bangkok demonstrations and brought terrorism charges against the movement's exiled leader  Thaksin Shinawatra.
 On July 6  Mr. Abhisit renewed a state of emergency in Bangkok and 18 other provinces  allowing his regime to arrest and hold people without charge  censor the media and prevent public gatherings. Meanwhile  he has announced that the parliamentary elections he had offered to hold in November will be postponed until next year. If this is what he calls ""national reconciliation "" Mr. Abhisit  a graduate of Eton and Oxford  must have taken a lesson in Orwellian language.
 Mr. Thaksin and the red shirts have contributed to Thailand's impasse by blockading the center of Bangkok for two months last spring and for refusing the compromise Mr. Abhisit offered before the violence began and the army moved in. But the root cause of the troubles is the refusal of the traditional political class  the military and the royal court  which Mr. Abhisit's government represents  to accept the results of democratic elections.
 Repression will not solve this problem. If Mr. Abhisit really wants reconciliation  the steps he must take are clear: End the state of emergency  release the red shirt leaders and negotiate leading to elections  with a commitment by all sides to allow the winners to rule within the boundaries of a reformed constitution.";Negative
