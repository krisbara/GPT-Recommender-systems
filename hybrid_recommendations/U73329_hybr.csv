According to Accuweather, the winds in the tornado reached ""between 113 and 157 mph."" Diaz posted footage of the moment he was filming a ""dusty EF-2 tornado at close range"" as the hailstones almost hit ""the camera from behind,"" to Twitter on October 17. The lucky storm chaser told Storyful the footage was recorded on May 5. No injuries were reported as a result of the storm.
