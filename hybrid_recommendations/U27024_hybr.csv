According to Accuweather, the winds in the tornado reached ""between 113 and 157 mph."" Diaz posted footage of the moment he was filming a ""dusty EF-2 tornado at close range"" as the hailstones almost hit ""the camera from behind,"" to Twitter on October 17. The lucky storm chaser told Storyful the footage was recorded on May 5. No injuries were reported as a result of the storm.

N4015,video,popculture,"Following Trump's endorsement, Spicer has emotional night on 'Dancing With the Star' It was an emotional night for Sean Spicer on Dancing With the Stars, Monday. President Trump's former press secretary dedicated his performance to his father, who passed away in 2016 from pancreatic cancer. ""This is an opportunity to pay homage to my father, a great man, a great friend, a great inspiration,"" said Spicer, """"I'd like to dedicate this dance to my dad and all the fathers out there suffering from cancer but still being the best dad that they can."" The theme of the show was Disney Night and Spicer danced as the character Woody from Toy Story 4. His quickstep was his most well received dance and he earned his first 7 score from the judges. After his performance, Spicer became emotional because Disney Night reminded him of one of his last memories with his father. ""It was a great experience to be able to share that whole experience with my kids and my mother and father,"" said Spicer, ""So to know that it was actually the ride that we went on, it was kind of cool.""",1.0,0.2388201697696237,0.6194100848848119,0.4925467798464158
