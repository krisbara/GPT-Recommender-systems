According to Accuweather, the winds in the tornado reached ""between 113 and 157 mph."" Diaz posted footage of the moment he was filming a ""dusty EF-2 tornado at close range"" as the hailstones almost hit ""the camera from behind,"" to Twitter on October 17. The lucky storm chaser told Storyful the footage was recorded on May 5. No injuries were reported as a result of the storm. However, the cyclone ripped through agricultural areas, ""causing structural damage to farms and wrecking equipment, power lines, and irrigation systems,"" according to media reports. Diaz may be better served in the future by heeding the advice of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). According to NOAA, ""if you are unable to make it to a safe shelter, either get down in your car and cover your head, or abandon your car and seek shelter in a low lying area such as a ditch or ravine.""
