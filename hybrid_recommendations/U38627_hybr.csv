However, the cyclone ripped through agricultural areas, ""causing structural damage to farms and wrecking equipment, power lines, and irrigation systems,"" according to media reports. Diaz may be better served in the future by heeding the advice of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
